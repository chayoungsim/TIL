    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // 원래배열은 변경하지 않고 새로운 배열을 만든다.

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    console.log(players,team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{number:99});

    console.log(person,cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
